Issues with GNU autotools
=========================

Many source packages use GNU autotools to manage their building. You can
typically recognise this because their build instructions tell you to::

  ./configure; make; make install

and you will typically see files called ``configure.ac`` and ``Makefile.in``
in the source tree.

The GNU autotools derive from a time when writing portable C code was quite
difficult, and typically required hand-editing a Makefile (often derived from
the X11 build system) in arcane ways. They have, in many ways, been a great
success, and for most people, most of the time, are a good thing.

However, their decision to rely only on ``bash``, ``m4`` and GNU ``make``
renders the system somewhat cumbersome (the original designers did not want to
add yet another tool which would need to be built and/or distributed - in
retrospect a mistake). The lack of adequate documentation, the tendency of
packages to "copy" mostly working autotools setups from other packages, and
the way that changes to autotools propagate do not help (there's a rant there,
which I shall try to avoid - it's very boring).

Regardless, when one is assembling a muddle build system, various common
problems keep reappearing, and this chapter of the documentation is meant to
be a place where we can keep a note of such problems, and their solutions.

Resources
=========
There are, at time of writing, two invaluable resources for learning about
autotools.

The first is:

  | **Autotools: A practitioner's guide to GNU AUTOCONF, AUTOMAKE and LIBTOOL**
  | John Calcote
  | No Starch Press, 2010
  | ISBN 1-59327-206-5

This is an introduction to the toolset, with a worked explanation on how to
setup a new project (or convert an existing one) to use autotools, written by
someone who believes strongly in the system. If you need to use autotools it
is worth finding a copy.

The second is online:

  | Autotools Mythbuster
  | https://autotools.io/
  | Diego Elio “Flameeyes” Pettenò

His blog, at https://blog.flameeyes.eu/, can also be fairly instructive.

Muddle won't pull because files have changed
============================================
Typically, muddle will grumble that::

  Failure pulling checkout:SOMENAME/pulled[T] in src/libs/SOMENAME:
  There are uncommitted changes/untracked files
       M Makefile.in
       M aclocal.m4
       M configure
       M include/Makefile.in

Useful resources for an explanation include:

* http://blog.flameeyes.eu/2008/06/maintaner-mode
* http://www.flameeyes.eu/autotools-mythbuster/automake/maintainer.html
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5731023/autotools-force-make-not-to-rebuild-configure-makefile

There are several things going on that cause the problem:

* Various revision control systems (the stackoverflow thread talks about CVS,
  but this is true of git as well) do not preserve timestamps when creating
  working files. This means that the relative timestamps of files in a newly
  clone git directory are not necessarily predictable, and are certainly not
  guaranteed to be related to the timestamps in the original checkin.

* The main operating system may have a different version of autotools
  installed (or its constituent packages) than are present/referenced in the
  checkout SOMENAME.

* There is a thing called "maintainer mode" in the autotools world. This can
  cause various source files to be regenerated if the autotools system
  believes this to be necessary. How it works has changed over time, as is
  often the case with autotools.

* The ``configure`` script is generated from ``configure.ac`` (which is much
  more readable!), and the ``Makefile.in`` files are generated from
  ``Makefile.am`` templates.

So, it is probable that this source checkout SOMENAME has a ``configure.ac``
which either does not contain the ``AM_MAINTAINER_MODE`` macro (causing it to
default to enabled), or else does contain it but explicitly enables maintainer
mode.

Since maintainer mode is enabled, running ``./configure`` can trigger a check
to see whether the ``configure`` script is "more recent" than its
``configure.ac``, and similarly for other derived files. A check may also be
made against the system autools setup. If the check makes it look as if
something is out of date, then the autotools system can decide to regenerate
files *in the source directory*, leading to our problem.

There are three possible solutions, of varying complexity.

1. The Makefile.muddle is building with reference to the source directory -
   for instance::

        config:
                -mkdir -p $(MUDDLE_OBJ_OBJ)
                (cd $(MUDDLE_OBJ_OBJ); \
                    $(MUDDLE_SRC)/configure  --host=armv7-none-linux-gnueabi \
                    --prefix=/  )

   and thus the autotools system can overwrite files in that source directory.
   So a simple, if blunt, solution is to copy the source tree first, and any
   amendments will then be made in that copy::

        config:
                -mkdir -p $(MUDDLE_OBJ_OBJ)
                $(MUDDLE) copywithout $(MUDDLE_SRC) $(MUDDLE_OBJ_OBJ) .git
                (cd $(MUDDLE_OBJ_OBJ); \
                    ./configure  --host=armv7-none-linux-gnueabi \
                    --prefix=/  )

   The snag with this approach is that if a file in the source directory is
   edited, ``muddle reconfigure`` is needed to copy the entire source tree
   over again.

   However, this is undoubtedly the simplest and quickest solution.

   .. note:: This is a traditional approach, which is known to work, although
      with the disadvantages mentioned.

2. If the ``configure.ac`` file *does* include the ``AM_MAINTAINER_MODE``
   macro, then it *should* be possible to specify
   ``--disable-maintainer-mode`` to the ``configure`` step::

        config:
                -mkdir -p $(MUDDLE_OBJ_OBJ)
                (cd $(MUDDLE_OBJ_OBJ); \
                    $(MUDDLE_SRC)/configure  --host=armv7-none-linux-gnueabi \
                    --disable-maintainer-mode \
                    --prefix=/  )

   (Note that the GNU autotools documentation does not mention the limitation
   that the ``AM_MAINTAINER_MODE`` macro needs to be present for this to
   work).

   Unfortunately, many packages do not include that macro in their
   ``configure.ac``, and there is some debate in the community as to whether
   it *should* be there or not (for instance, see
   http://old.nabble.com/-PATCH-libwacom--Drop-AM_MAINTAINER_MODE-td34561358.html).

   .. warning:: This approach should work, but I have not personally had
      the opportunity to try it, as most of the packages I've had to fix
      were either before I discovered this solution, or have not had
      ``AM_MAINTAINER_MODE`` defined.

3. If the ``configure.ac`` does *not* contain the ``AM_MAINTAINER_MODE``
   macro, it is possible to add it, regenerate the autotools setup for the
   package, and then commit the lot. The ``AM_MAINTAINER_MODE`` macro
   can then either explicitly disable maintainer mode, or enable it and the
   ``configure`` usage can disable it with the ``--disable-maintainer-mode``
   switch.

   As an example of someone external doing this sort of thing, see this pull
   request on github: https://github.com/craftIk/craftIk/pull/12

   To regenerate the ``configure`` and other files, use ``autoreconf`` - this
   is silent without ``-v`` switch::

     cd SOMENAME
     autoreconf -v

   Note that this will typically generate a diretory called
   ``autom4te.cache``, which you should add to your ``.gitignore`` (and
   perhaps also delete after use).

   .. warning:: This is an inadequate summary of what to do, and may be
      misleading. I hope to improve it in a later version of this document...
